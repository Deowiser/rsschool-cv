## Code example:
[__Head, Tail, Init and Last__](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54592a5052756d5c5d0009c3) Kata from CODEWARS
##### DESCRIPTION:
Haskell has some useful functions for dealing with lists:
```
$ ghci
GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
λ head [1,2,3,4,5]
1
λ tail [1,2,3,4,5]
[2,3,4,5]
λ init [1,2,3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4]
λ last [1,2,3,4,5]
5
```
Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:
```
| HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
[  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
| <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |

head [x] = x
tail [x] = []
init [x] = []
last [x] = x
```
Here's how I expect the functions to be called in your language:
```
head([1,2,3,4,5]); => 1
tail([1,2,3,4,5]); => [2,3,4,5]
```
### My solution ⤵️
```
function head(arr) {return arr[0]}

function tail(arr) {return arr.slice(1)}

function init(arr) {return arr.slice(0, -1)}

function last(arr) {return arr[arr.length - 1]}
```
